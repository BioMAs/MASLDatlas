# User Guide

## Overview

MASLDatlas is an interactive platform for exploring single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data related to Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). It supports analysis across Human, Mouse, and Zebrafish models.

## Features

### Multi-species Analysis
-   **Human**: Comprehensive cell type annotations.
-   **Mouse**: Comparative genomics models.
-   **Zebrafish**: Developmental studies.
-   **Integrated**: Cross-species analysis capabilities.

### Interactive Visualization
-   **UMAP Plots**: Visualize cell clusters and gene expression in 2D space.
-   **Filtering**: Real-time filtering based on metadata and gene expression levels.

### Differential Expression
-   Perform differential expression analysis between groups of cells.
-   Visualize results using Volcano plots and heatmaps.

### Pathway Analysis
-   **Gene Set Enrichment**: Analyze biological pathways using GO, KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways.
-   **Activity Scoring**: Estimate pathway activities using PROGENy and CollecTRI.

## Usage

1.  **Select Dataset**: Choose the species and dataset you wish to analyze from the sidebar.
2.  **Explore**: Use the tabs to navigate between different analysis modules (Visualization, Differential Expression, Enrichment).
3.  **Export**: Download plots and data tables for offline use.

## Data Management

Datasets are automatically managed by the application. If new datasets are added to the configuration, they will be downloaded automatically upon the next restart.
